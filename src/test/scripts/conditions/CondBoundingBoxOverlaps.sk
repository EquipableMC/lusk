test "CondBoundingBoxOverlaps":
  assert new bounding box from vector(0,0,0) and vector(2,2,2) overlaps new bounding box from vector(1,1,1) and vector(3,3,3) with "bounding boxes overlap"
  assert new bounding box from vector(0,0,0) and vector(1,1,1) doesn't overlaps new bounding box from vector(2,2,2) and vector(3,3,3) with "bounding boxes don't overlap"
